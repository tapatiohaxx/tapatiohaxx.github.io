<h1> <u> CTFs : </u> </h1>

<h3> Cellebrite CTF 2023 (20-27 September 2023) </h3>
<p> Conducted a mobile forensic investigation with the Celebrite Physical Examiner Pro software to find several types of artifacts. </p> 

<p> What I Did </p>
<ul>
<li> Utilized many different techniques such to extract messaging data, photos, location data, usage data and other data from an iOS image using Cellebrite Physical Analyzer pro. </li>
<li> Utilized many different techniques such to extract messaging data, photos, location data, usage data and other data from an Android image using Cellebrite Physical Analyzer pro. </li>
<li> Cross referenced data between different phones to help form a story which the four images used were all part of. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Magnet Forensics Virtual CTF 2023 (3-6 May 2023) </h3>
<p> Solved challenges based on steganography, cryptography and android forensics. </p> 

<p> What I Did </p>
<ul>
<li> Used Magnet Axiom 7.0 and the Android Logs, Events and Protobuf Parser (ALEAPP) to extract information from an android image. </li>
<li> Solved cryptography challenges using CyberChef. Also solved Steganography challenges using Audacity and DeepSound </li>

<h1> <u> Classes : </u> </h1>

<h3> Belkasoft X iOS Foensics Course (15-30 September 2023) </h3>
<p> Recieved training on iOS forensics. Learned how to detect and analyze data from iOS devices through various methods and locations. </p> 

<p> What I Did </p>
<ul>
<li> Studied and performed iOS data extraction techniques such as agent-based acquisition, iCloud recovery and jailbreak acquisition to compare amounts of data produced by each technique. </li>
<li> Analyzed knowledgeC.db utilizing SQL commands to discover how iOS stores app usage data, internet activity, device state, and other important user-related data such as music playback data. </li>
<li> Conducted a practical case with iCloud backups, Signal data (with Apple Keychain) and WhatsApp data, and full iOS system dumps to observe iOS system structure and artifact locations. </li>
</ul>
